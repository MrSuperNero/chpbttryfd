                        God, I really took it too far with this. Listen, I gotta be real with y'all:  it lowkey wasn't easy making this.
                        ...
                        <span class="rainbow">LIES!!</span>
                        This was super easy. I can do anything. I'm the <span class="textGrowth">f**87^&^%ing MIchAel JoRdAn</span> of cooking food (with butter)
                        I can't believe you fell for that "fake news"
                        <span class="bangers rainbow">This dish is so good that it can be eaten with other food.</span> It could be the Scottie Pippen to the MJ of food (MJ of food = eggs, leet's be real, change my mind, I dare you)
                        Of course, since this dish is a little advanced, we had to bring in some Tony Stark hardware with the cast iron skillet.
                        It's lowkey kinda expensive and a pain to maintain but it'll elevate your game by 2 points which can be a lot depending on your perspective.
                        In all honesty, just get a regular pan. the potatoes won't be as crunchy but, hey, beggars can't be choosers
                        All you gotta do is melt butter and put cut potatoes in the pan, cover it up, and let it burn. The potatoes can be any shape you want. 
                        <div class="textRotate">
                            They can be long and thin or small and thick. All depends on your preference 
                            (although almost everyone wants long and thick because beauty standards but that's impossible because nature and biology)
                        </div>
                        and it goes without saying that you gotta season food. like everything on these newsletters gotta be seasoned. You knew that right? Please tell me you knew that.
                        Don't disappoint me and tell me you've been eating unseasoned food. I'd rather disown you all right now.
