                    <p>A deceiving dish that promised so much but failed to deliver on all aspects. It's basically the Johnny Manziel of buttery foods.
                        This is the one night stand that promised to be everything you wanted but it turned out to be Big Ed from 90 Day Fianc√©.
                        I mean, come on, this thing was supposed to be only two ingredients: spaghetti and butter. It had so much potential.
                        Spaghetti is the carrier of all taste, the vehicle of deliciousness, but spaghetti with butter just tastes as bland
                        as I would imagine battery acid would taste like. I couldn't even fix the taste, no matter how much butter I put on it,
                        So I had to resort to some desperate measures: adding cheese and cajun seasoning to the dish.
                        It made it a lot better, thank god, but by then, I couldn't even taste the spaghetti nor the butter.
                        Anyways, godspeed if you want to eat this overrated, overhyped dream killer of a food.</p>
