                    Thank you for spending your valuable time perusing this website of mine.
                    2020 has obviously been a crazy year for us all, what with the Black Lives Matter Movement
                    evolving into what it is today, and even the Coronavirus essentially destroying society as we know it.
                    With all the death of so many people including prominent figures such as Kobe Bryant (I cried when I heard the news),
                    life seems to have permanently changed for us all. In all honesty, I highly doubt things will ever go back to normal.
                    That person you were talking to and things were about to go to first-and-a-half base is now gone forever. 
                    The presidential election for 2020 is one of the jankiest and set-up things I've ever seen.
                    Honestly, society looks more staged than Hamilton live (I actually wouldn't know because I've never seen Hamilton).
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Good luck coming to peace with all this mess. 
                </p>

                    Anyways, the whole purpose of this website is really me just finding a way to cope and deal with all the anxiety and stress
                    this year (but really the past 30 years of my life even though I'm 20). I hope y'all enjoyed the journey with me. Here's to more time together.
